        <h1>The Kardeshev Scale</h1>

                    The Kardeshev Scale measures a civilization by their energy use. An anthill is a type 0 civilization. They use the power of their planet but does not use its true power. A type 1 civilization is able to harness the true power of their planet. They can control everything that happens on their planet.  A type 2 civilization is able to harness the power of their star. One way they might achieve this is by constructing a Dyson Sphere.  They can control everything that is in the solar system. A type 3 civilization is able to harness the power of a galaxy and can control everything inside the galaxy. They can merge stars, absorb supernovae, use the planets as building blocks, and even create stars. A type 4 civilization can harness the power of the universe. They have access to several, if not all galaxies. They can also create gigantic projects, bend space-time, and even reach immortality on a grand scale. A type 5 civilization can harness the power of several universes. Welcome to meta-physics. They can manipulate time. A type 6 civilization exists OUT of time and space. They have the ability to create universes and multiverses and destroy them.


                    If there are so many alien species waiting to be discovered, why haven't we found any aliens yet. Wouldnâ€™t finding a new species be great? The answer is no. The reason for that is because of something called the Great Filter. Filters are obstacles life has to overcome. Most of the filters are just small roadblocks to stop us from becoming a type 3 civilization. 
                But there is a filter called the Great Filter that probably stopped something like life from being created or stopping civilizations from becoming a type 3 civilization like nuclear war that destroys them. There are two scenarios. The first scenario is that the Great Filter is behind us. We have overcome it. This is good. The other scenario is that the great filter is ahead of us. This is bad. This is why finding alien life is not good. That means the great filter is not behind us, but ahead of us. Finding bacteria on another planet is not good, finding primitive life forms is bad, finding intelligent species is alarming, and finding great civilizations is horrible. Humans are special. When the only life-form on Earth was bacteria, one special thing happened that could only happen once. A larger cell swallowed a smaller cell. But the bigger cell did not eat the smaller one. Instead, they unified. The bigger cell protected the smaller cell and the smaller cell made efficient energy for the larger cell. This allowed them to evolve into more complex life-forms. Could that be the Great Filter? 
                If so, then we have overcome it.

                    Humans are currently a type 0.73 civilization. Over the next 100-200 years, we will become a type 1 civilization.
