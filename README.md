        <h2>The Domains of Life</h2>
        <p>By Octavius Szeto</p>
        <p>Scientists say that in order to be considered alive, something must be able to do the following 4 things.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reproduce</li>
            <li>Grow in size</li>
            <li>Give off waste</li>
            <li>Respond to external stimuli</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That's what something must be able to do in order to be considered alive.</p>
        <p>Now, you might be wondering what the three domains of life are. The 3 domains of life are: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Domain Bacteria</li>
            <li>Domain Archaea</li>
            <li>Domain Eukarya</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Sadly, I won't tell you more about each of the domains. Most of these facts are just to impress your friends, or make you sound smart at a party. <br>

        <h2>Muscles</h2>
        <p>By Octavius Szeto</p>
        <p>Muscles help you move around. Without them, you wouldn't get anywhere!                                                                                                         <ul>
            <li>How many are there?</li>
            <li>Can they do cartwheels?</li>
            <li>Do they like Wendys or Mcdonalds?</li>
            <li>Can they stain your clothes?</li>
        </ul>These are all normal questions. (Okay, maybe only one is normal.) There are 650 of them in your body. You use all of them to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Skip</li>
            <li>Blink</li>
            <li>Sit</li>
            <li>Stand</li>
            <li>Walk</li>
            <li>Say "Yadda Yadda Yadda"</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The point is, you need muscles in order to survive. For some fun facts, check out Volume Seven - Random Facts. <br>If you want to learn more, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle">Click Here</a></p>

    <h2>Real Life Transformers</h2>
    <p>By Octavius Szeto</p>
    <p>The J-deite RIDE robot is modeled after the Transformer toys. It can shift from a car, to a robot, and back again. It can make the change in one minute. The car can seat two. It weighs as much as a rhino and stands as tall as an elephant. When it is in its car form, it can go up to 37mph. Hit a button on a remote control and it turns into an robot. When it is in its robot form, it can walk 328 feet an hour. The J-deite RIDE was designed by a group of Japanese engineers.</p>
